# QTrip_Dynamic
Dynamic Traveling Website

We will be designing a dynamic travel website which can be publicly shared. 
Takeaways: 
1. Understand how to design webpages using HTML and CSS. 
2. Make webpages dynamic using JavaScript. 
3. Deploy the website using Netlify and Render.

The cloud based deployment makes both the Backend (using render) and Frontend (using netlify) publicly accessible and independent of your local system. 
Any time you want to update them, you can redeploy the updated code.

The learnings includes:

- Linking of JavaScript to HTML

- Invocation of REST API and parsing the data in the response

- Updating the DOM of an HTML page

- Converting a static website to a dynamic one by adding methods that can react to user interaction and events

- Local storage to improve user experience

- Using JavaScript libraries and inbuilt methods

- Some key components needed for websites including the layout, stylesheet, form, table, bootstrap, carousel, responsiveness, links etc.

- Deployment using Netlify and Render
